## My name is Denilson Márcio, but you can call me Dennis 🤘.

🎓 I have a **degree in Systems Analysis and Development** from the **Faculty of Technology of São Paulo - Fatec Zona Sul**.

💍 Married, and father of a beautiful little girl named Lívia, 3 years old 👶.

💻 Passionate about technology and computers since a very young age, 📓 I decided to direct my studies to the area of software development.

Currently I have developed some personal projects with the **Python** language 🐍, which I confess I am really enjoying 🥰🥰🥰.

I also had the opportunity to do some projects with **API PHP** and **JSON**, I have been improving my knowledge in **JS**, **NodeJs**, **Java**, **Git**, **Scrum** and **SQL**
