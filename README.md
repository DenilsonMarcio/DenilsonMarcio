### Hello people !!!
## My name is Denilson MÃ¡rcio, but you can call me Dennis.

I have a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from the Faculty of Technology of SÃ£o Paulo - Fatec Zona Sul.

Married, and father of a beautiful little girl named LÃ­via, 3 years old.

Passionate about technology and computers since a very young age, I decided to direct my studies to the area of software development.

Currently I have developed some personal projects with the Python language, which I confess I am really enjoying.
